# Traffic Light Management using RL
This repository contains my work on contolling traffic lights in road intersections using Deep Reinforcement Learning on the [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/) (Simuation of Urban MObility) simulator. This repository will be a collection of my experiements and code. It is a work in progress and the structure and content of the repo can and will change in the future. I am working on this project on multiple phases:

- __Phase 1__: Implement for a single intersection.
- __Phase 2__: Implement for a grid of intersections.
- __Phase 3__: Implement on a real world road network with real world traffic flow data.

## Current Progress:
Phase 1 is underway, so far, I have created a prototype baseline RL model that can perform decently. As of now, I am doing a comparative study between my model and current methods used for traffic signal control. After this, improvement of the prototype model would be done.

You can find the video of my model working in [this](https://youtu.be/LP0BYv9mwDE?si=KnioH-WXVDXrLo1T) (Cityflow Simulator) and [this](https://youtu.be/5Zpo7wx7vFY?si=znLREEitTubWT4Hp) (SUMO Simulator) videos.
